\begin{abstract}
In this proposal we are trying to figure out how to design and manufacture multipole RF trap chips as a brick for larger trap constructions of higher geometric and topological complexity.
To accomplish the fiddly part of attain a concerted multifold of kind of synchronized RF sub-traps on those ceramics substrate chips (we'll call them bricks for pun reasons) we are using a hybrid PLL approach to experiment with different synchronisation strategies.
That means every brick has its own PLL-ed HF trap drivers. To get rid of bulky cavity or helical resonators, we are testing the feasibility of using piezo resonators - in our case simply off-the-shelf quartz resonators.
